### 🎶 **Best Albums for 2025**

My favorite album of 2025 is undoubtedly **Saving Grace**, the twelfth studio release from the legendary Led Zeppelin singer, **Robert Plant**, featuring the talented Suzi Dians. This album showcases the band Plant has toured with since 2019 and includes ten cover versions of songs from a range of artists.  Robert recorded this album over a span of seven years, the care he put into creating it.  He's a true icon, but this album has earned its spot as my #1 favorite among all his solo projects. Check out Higher Rock from this album. I highly recommend checking out his recent [Tiny Desk concert](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHL5ApOqMQc).  

My second favorite album of the year has to be **Foxes in the Snow** by the incredibly talented **Jason Isbell**. Released in early 2025, this marks his tenth studio album, and it's a beautifully crafted acoustic masterpiece recorded in just five days.  From start to finish, every track, the raw emotion and artistry shine through, showcasing Isbell's growth as a songwriter. I've been fortunate enough to catch him live several times this year—both with the 400 Unit at the iconic Ryman Auditorium and in a more intimate solo performance in Oakland. Each show felt like a distinct experience.  Here's a [track from the album](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3EDBkcCRDo).

At 86 years young, the legendary **Mavis Staples** has graced us with her latest album, **Sad and Beautiful World**. This delightful release showcases her incredible talent, featuring a star-studded lineup of guest instrumentalists, including Bon Iver's Justin Vernon, as well as close friends Bonnie Raitt and Buddy Guy.   Mavis truly shines on tracks like "[Hard Times](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBnM7QmBTpA)," written by Gillian Welch and Dave Rawlings, and the classic "Satisfied Mind," originally by Porter Wagoner. Her powerful voice and emotional delivery never fail to resonate, reminding us why she's such an icon in the music world.  Having had the pleasure of seeing Mavis live multiple times, I can attest to the warmth and positivity she brings to each performance. There's something undeniably special about her presence that makes every concert a memorable experience. If you have the chance, I highly recommend catching her live or giving her new album a listen—you won't be disappointed!
