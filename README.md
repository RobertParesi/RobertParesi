## 🎶 **Best Albums for 2025**

Chicago's **Mavis Staples**, 86, released **“Sad and Beautiful World”**. The album also features a who's who of guest instrumentalists, including Bon Iver's Justin Vernon and old friends Bonnie Raitt and Buddy Guy.  She does a great version of Hard Times by Gillian Welch and Dave Rawling.  I've seen her live over 5 times and has such a positive and beautiful presense about her at her shows.  I highly recommend.
